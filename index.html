                    <h2>Instructions</h2>
                    <ol>
                    <li>
                        Put two yolks in a large bowl. Also add 40 grams of fresh yeast. Same with dry yeast (if you use one). Mash the yolks with yeast and cooled, sweet milk and butter. Add the sifted flour. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes. I make them by hand, but you can use a hook mixer or a thermomix machine.
        
        Leave a smooth ball of well-made dough to rise for at least 1.5 hours. The dough should be in a bowl, covered with a cotton cloth or foil. You can put the bowl in a slightly preheated oven (up to 40 degrees. Then I recommend that you slightly open the oven door, because the temperature in the chamber may be higher than the indicator shows. If it is too hot in the oven cavity, we can "kill" the yeast). I do it mainly in winter, when the temperature at home does not exceed 21 degrees. The dough should even triple in volume (rise very nicely).
        
        Advice: I give half a glass of milk, but you can go ahead with 3/4 cup of milk. Especially if you think that the milk is evaporating when you heat it up. You can also add yeast directly to the flour, do not rub them with the yolks first.
                    </li>

        Poppy seed mass for the poppy seed cake
        
        If you want to make homemade poppy seed cake, follow my recipe - home made poppy seed cake. I recommend that you prepare a larger portion of the mass and freeze some of it. Such a mass can be stored in a freezer for up to a year. To 600 grams of poppy seeds, add three egg whites, beaten semi-rigid. Lightly stir the egg white into the mass. Thanks to this, the poppy seed mass will not crumble when cutting the dough.
        
        If you are using ready-made mass, check its taste after taking it out. If it is too wet, I recommend frying it in an open frying pan with one teaspoon of butter. Set the burner to low power. The excess water will evaporate. You can also add crushed walnuts to the mass. After it has cooled down, add the whipped whites of the two eggs. Lightly toss the egg foam into the mixture.
        
        How to roll a poppy seed cake?
        
        Put the dough ball on the dough board. There is a lot of butter in this yeast dough and there is no need to sprinkle it with flour. The dough should not stick to the wooden top. Roll out the dough into a cake 1-1.5 cm thick. Put the poppy seed mass on the cake - as in the photo below.
        </li>
        
        <li>
        Roll the poppy seed cake. After it is rolled, put it on baking paper and fold it twice, leaving about 1 cm of loose space. Thanks to this, the poppy seed cake will not "unfold to the sides" during baking.
        
        NOTE - this poppy seed cake is very long and may not fit in your oven. If there is such a risk, I recommend cutting it into two shorter poppy seed cake or divide the dough into two balls and wrap two poppy seed cake.
        
        Place the paper-wrapped poppy seed cake on the baking tray, on the middle shelf of the oven. The oven should be heated to 180 degrees with hot air, or 190 degrees with baking up and down. Bake the poppy seed cake for 40 minutes. After turning the oven off, slightly open its door for 15 minutes. After this time, you can take out the poppy seed cake, unwrap it from paper and leave it on a wire rack to cool it down and decorate it.
        
        Poppy seed cake can be sprinkled with powdered sugar or covered with frosting. I recommend the traditional royal icing. The icing will solidify faster if, after pouring and sprinkling the poppy seed cake with dry poppy seeds, you put the dough for a few minutes in an oven preheated to 80 degrees.

                    <h2>Instructions</h2>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Instructions</strong>
                        <p>
                        Warm palm oil in a skillet (frying pan) for about 1 minute. Do NOT bleach it.
                        Pour the all ingredients except the meat and fish into a blender. Pulse until it is well mixed and yellowish. Taste to ensure that seasoning is perfect. Add a little salt if needed (I assume your beef stock is salted so you might not need to add a lot more salt).
                        You might find some bubbles at the top of the soup. That is totally okay. Pour over the meat/fish and mix. Alternately, you could keep the meat seperately from the soup and put it on the side while serving.
                        Serve with some achu!
                        </p>
                        <strong>To make the achu</strong>
                        <p>
                        Wash cocoyams and place in a pot with skin on. If also using large cocoyams ("mami coco") and "achu banana", place the large cocoyams at the bottom of the pot then add in the small cocoyams and top with the bananas. 
                        Boil until cocoyams are soft and the skin comes off easily.
                        While they are still warm, peel and process to a paste in a food processor. Traditionally, they are pounded in a mortar but a food processor can do the job though it might not give you a very smooth paste.
                        Again, if you are using "achu bananas", start by processing them first then mixing the banana with the first two batches of cocoyams so they remain warm.
                        When it is all processed, place into a serving bowl and serve. You could also wrap the achu into lumps using warmed banana leaves or aluminium foil.
